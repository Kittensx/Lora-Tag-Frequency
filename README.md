# Lora-Tag-Frequency
Creates a txt file which shows the 3 top ranked ranges for tags while also searching for activation text for the Lora. 

This repository is meant to run in the background and monitors files. You can also just run it once for your target folders, and run it each time you add new Lora to your folders. For example outputs, see "output examples" folder.

This is a placeholder readme while I work out functionality, and is meant to work like a coming soon.

Without  the tagfreq_class.py file this repository will not work.
