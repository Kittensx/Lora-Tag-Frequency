# Known issues
## 1. Does not recognize all loras. It functions right now by looking for loras that have specific fields, in particular, "ss_tag_frequency" in the metadata. If that specific word does not exist, and it is formatted a different way, this won't pick up the tags.
## 2. Trigger words - the first entry after ss_tag_frequency may be the name of the image set or it may be the trigger word. I'm not 100%, hence the language, "Possible Triggerword".
